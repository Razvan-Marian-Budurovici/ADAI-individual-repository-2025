# Week One Research Questions

### Skin Lesions
- What types of skin lesions exist, and why is it important to distinguish between them for diagnosis?

### Stakeholders
- Who are the main stakeholders (patients, doctors, hospitals, government, system admins), and what are their roles in using such a model?

### Model (CNN)
- How does a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) work for image classification?

### Data Requirements
- What requirements should a dataset meet (size, source, quality, variety, labelling) to be useful for developing a CNN?

### Training
- How is a CNN trained, and what challenges can occur during training?

### Deeper Understanding / Limits
- What are the main limitations of CNN models (in diagnosing skin cancer)?

### Data Quality / Assessment
- How do data quality factors (size, source, labelling, variety, representation) affect model performance?

### Performance Measures
- What performance measures (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, consistency) are used to assess the model, and how do they differ from each other?

### Interpret Results
- How can CNN predictions be interpreted and presented in a way that is meaningful and useful for doctors and patients?


# Week Two Research Questions

### Data Labelling
